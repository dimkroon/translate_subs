myself, Senior Directorate
Officer Eric Gray;

our American guest,
Emmett Kurzfeld

85
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,960
of the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency;

86
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
and returning
British Operational Officer

87
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,640
Lorraine Broughton.

88
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,000
Before we begin, sir,
may I formally request

89
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,800
that Mr. Kurzfeld be removed

90
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,000
-from the debriefing.
-Request denied.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,960
What I have to tell you, sir,
is not for the CIA to hear.

92
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,160
Lorraine, you are the subject
of this debriefing,

93
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,960
-not its controller.
-I understand that.

KURZFELD:
I was there, in Berlin.

95
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,960
And I'm here with the full
executive authority of Langley.

96
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
If it'd make you
more comfortable,

97
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,320
I could stand behind the mirror
with everybody else.

98
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,960
But it's a little crowded
back there.

99
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,480
(quietly):
Cocksucker.

100
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,960
What did you say?

101
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
I didn't say anything.

102
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
I'm sorry. Did you say
something, Lorraine?

103
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,000
Did you hear me say something?

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,800

-What did she say?

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,960
LORRAINE:
What?

106
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,960

107
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960

108
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
do you want
to play the tape back?

109
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,960
(sighing):
Well, then...

110
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Shall we begin?

111
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Berlin.

112
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,640
What happened?

113
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
Yeah.

114
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,960
(chuckles softly)
Berlin.

115
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
(inhales deeply)

116
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
(long exhale)

117
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,320
Fuck.

118
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,960
(thunder rumbling)

119
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
GRAY:
Ah. Lorraine.

120
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Sorry to bring you in
on such short notice.

121
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
You know C.

122
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,960
-Yes. -We were just
going over your file.

123
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,960
I see your Russian
is excellent.

124
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,960
An expert in escape
and evasion.

125
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,640
Proficient
in intelligence collection

126
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,320
and hand-to-hand combat.

127
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,960
It's an impressive set
of skills.

128
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Knowing the Reds as I do,

129
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,320
she'll need to use
every damn one of them.

130
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,960
I'll get straight to the point.

131
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,640
How well do you know
James Gascoigne?

132
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,960
Enough to say hello.

133
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
We worked together

134
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,960
-in Istanbul in '85.
-He's dead.

135
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,320
Gascoigne was killed last night
on a mission in Berlin.

136
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,800
GRAY:
The West German Police

137
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,960
fished his body out
of the Spree this morning.

138
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,480
And the coroner extracted
a 7.62 Tokarev round

139
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,960
from the base
of his skull.

140
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Soviets.

141
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Yesterday, Gascoigne met
with a Stasi officer,

142
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
code-named Spyglass.

143
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,160
We promised Spyglass immunity

144
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,960
in exchange
for a document on microfilm,

145
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,000
code-named "the list."

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,960
Hidden in a Swiss watch,
no less.

147
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,960
The list contains every active
clandestine officer,

148
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
all their shady deals.

149
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
It's an atomic bomb
of information

150
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,480
that could extend the Cold War
for another 40 years.

151
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,480
And we believe the man that
killed Gascoigne now has it.

152
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,960
Our sources point
to Yuri Bakhtin,

153
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,640
a KGB hatchet man with more
than a dozen confirmed kills.

154
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,960
LORRAINE:
So you want me in Moscow?

155
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
No.

156
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,160
Bakhtin never got
on the flight.

157
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,960
So he's still in Berlin,
along with the list.

158
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Everyone's hunting for it.

159
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
The Yanks, the Frogs.

160
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
Soviets, of course.

161
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
GRAY:
And our man, Percival.

162
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,640
Who's Percival?

163
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
David Percival.

164
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,960
He's our number one in Berlin.

165
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,000
(slide projector clicks)

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,960
He's your point
of contact now.

167
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,160
## Fight the power! #

168
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
## Fight the power... #

169
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Straight from the tit
of the Virgin Mary.

170
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,640
## We got to fight
the powers that be #

171
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
## As the rhythm's
designed to bounce #

172
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
## What counts
is that the rhyme's #

173
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,800
## Designed to fill your mind #

174
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
## Now that you realise
the pride's arrived #

175
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,960
## We got to pump the stuff
to make us tough #

176
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
## From the heart,
it's a start, a work of art #

177
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
## To revolutionize, make a
change, nothing's strange... #

178
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
The Jordache wasn't easy.

179
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
It's for my wife's birthday.

180
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
That's really nice.

181
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,000
Now, where's that fucking list?

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,960
I gave the microfilm
to Gascoigne last night.

183
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
James didn't show up.

184
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
I did my part.

185
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
I gave him the list.

186
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
You have to get me
and my family across.

187
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
It's not safe
for us any more here.

188
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
The Russians are onto me.

189
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
No list, no deal.

190
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
## In order to fight
the powers that be... #

191
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,960
-I risked everything.
-No list, no deal.

192
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
You listen to
me, Spyglass.

193
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,800
Without that list, why
shouldn't I take you outside

194
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,960
and shoot you
in the fucking head?

195
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
You are going to kill
a Stasi officer?

196
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
One that's about to defect
to the West? Yeah.

197
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,160
Without an embassy
to look after him,

198
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,960
Percival has gone
somewhat native.

199
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,960
C:
Gone fucking feral.

200
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Berlin is the Wild West.

201
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
If that bloody wall
comes crashing down,

202
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
we don't want to be under it.

203
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:56,640
If the Russians get that list,
we're all buggered sideways.

204
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,960
You're Elizabeth Lloyd.

205
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,800
A Cambridge-educated
lawyer

206
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,960
sent by
James Gascoigne's family

207
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,160
to retrieve
the body and effects

208
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,960
of their recently deceased son.

209
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Your mission is to connect
with Percival

210
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,960
and do whatever it takes
to get that list home.

211
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,960
C: And remember, Lorraine,
this is highly sensitive.

212
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Trust no-one.

213
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,960
-(siren blaring)
-(indistinct shouting)

214
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,320
PERCIVAL:
Follow me! Come, come, come!

215
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,160
Quickly! This way.

216
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,960
Tell me you made a copy.

217
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
-I memorized it.
-Memorized it?

218
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
Every single agent
on that list?

219
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Every Wednesday, you visit
the Penny Lane brothel.

220
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Your favorite girl is Margot.
Her real name is Maria.

221
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,000
Maria?

222
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,480
All right, I'll get you across.

223
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,960
-You're a good man, Percival.
-Fuck off.

224
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
I just want the list.
Once I've...

225
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
-Oh, fuck.
-OFFICER: Halt!

226
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
I'll be in touch.

227
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,640
-Uh...

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,480

00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Miss Broughton,
Mr. Percival was running late.

242
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
He sent me to pick you up.

243
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,640
Checked bags?

244
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,960
No, they've been sent.

245
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Please, follow me.

249
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,800
So... is this your first time
in Berlin?

250
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,480
Yes.

251
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,960
Well, it's a remarkable time
to be here.

252
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Wonderful music,
superb nightlife,

253
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,000
marvelous restaurants.

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You must try the Central Cafe
for a drink.

255
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,960
You'll need it later.

256
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,960
You remember Mr. Bremovych,
don't you?

257
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,960
Of course you do.

258
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,960
Well, he's very curious

259
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,960
what you're doing here
in Berlin.

Fuck's sake.

LORRAINE: Five
minutes on the ground,

283
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,960
-and I'm already made.
-You're not made, I hope.

284
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,640
-They knew my name.
-That's troubling.

285
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,960
-And yours.
-That's hardly surprising.

286
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,160
Great fucking start, Percival.

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,960
(tires screeching)

288
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,320
So, what was
your first impression?

289
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,960
Of David?

290
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Well...

291
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,320
he was handsome.

Late 30s.

-Mmm. -LORRAINE: I asked him
what the deal was with that,

296
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,960
and he said,
"It's to blend in."

297
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Want to touch it?

298
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
It's to blend in, in the East.

300
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,960
That was the Brandenburg Gate,
by the way.

301
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,160
I mean, how the fuck
do the suits think

302
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,960
that you're going to be
able to help me find that list?

303
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,000
As soon as you pick up
Gascoigne's body,

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,960
they'll null and void
your visa, and you'll be on

305
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
-the first flight back home.
-I'll figure it out.

306
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960

That's Checkpoint Charlie.

My office is just back there.

308
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,960
I'm not here to collect
postcards, Percival.

309
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Just drop me at my hotel.
It's around the corner.

310
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,960
I thought you said you'd
never been to Berlin before.

311
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
I can read a fucking map.

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
without the correct
information.

361
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
LORRAINE:
It's a simple mistake.

362
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
CORONER:
Miss Lloyd, in Germany,

363
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,960
we don't make simple mistakes.

364
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,480
## #

365
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
## #

366
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
(grunting)

367
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,320
I'm not going to lie,
I'm impressed.

368
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,960
You've got some balls
breaking in here.

369
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
You should see my balls.

370
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Then you'd be really impressed.

371
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Hmm.
I'll take your word for it.

372
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
I see you found a way to stay.

373
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,160
You wrote "16"
when it should have said "76."

374
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,960
That's right.

375
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
I'm not going anywhere.

376
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
I'm here for at least
another week.

377
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,960
Lucky fucking me.

378
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
They won't release the body now

379
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,960
until they've investigated
that red-tape nightmare.

380
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
How the fuck
did you get in here?

381
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
You know, I've been
in Berlin a long time,

382
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,320
and I think I know
every doorman

383
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,960
of every decent shithouse,
borderline decent flophouse

384
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
both sides of the wall.

385
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,960
Well, then you must know
Spyglass.

386
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,640
Never met the fellow.

387
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,960
He was James's.

388
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
What do you know
about this woman

389
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,160
who's been following me
since Tempelhof?

390
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,960
I'd say that you're
an attractive woman

391
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,960
and you should
do the math.

392
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
You know,
if I was to follow you,

393
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,960
I mean, properly,
you'd never fucking know.

394
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
There's a knack to it,
isn't there?

395
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,960
It's like walking a tightrope
or playing the bagpipes.

396
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,960
You can either do it
or you can't.

397
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
(inhales deeply)

398
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,480
Knock yourself out.

399
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,960
(exhales)

400
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,960
(bells chiming)

401
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,960
(watches ticking)

402
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,320
I'd like to purchase a watch.

403
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,960
I need access to a network
in East Berlin.

404
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Come back tomorrow
before closing.

405
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,160
REPORTER: East Berlin is
on a short fuse again tonight

406
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,960
as Communist Party officials
struggle to maintain order.

407
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,320
GRAY:How well do you know
James Gascoigne?

408
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,480
He's dead.

409
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,320
-You need to be careful.
-GRAY: The coroner
extracted

410
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,960
a 7.62 Tokarev round
from the base of his skull.

411
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,320
LORRAINE:
Soviets.

412
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,960
GRAY:
We know who Satchel is.

413
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,480
GASCOIGNE:
You need to run.

414
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,960
(gunshot echoing)

415
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,960
(gasping)

416
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,160
## #

417
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,160
## #

418
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,960
(door creaks quietly)

419
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
GRAY: You expected
to find the list

420
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
in Gascoigne's apartment.

421
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,960
You realise you were late
to the party.

422
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Percival, the Russians--

423
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,960
everybody must have already
ransacked the place.

424
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
LORRAINE:
Yes.

425
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,960
But the list
wasn't our only problem.

426
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,960
Before I left,
he told me one last thing.

427
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,960
This is exactly why
I didn't want the CIA present.

428
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
Spyglass revealed
that this list

429
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,960
would expose a double agent
by the name of Satchel.

430
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,960
C:
I want Satchel, dead or alive.

431
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,960
This traitor has been
a thorn in our side for years.

432
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,960
He's a black eye to the Crown.

433
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
And the single biggest

434
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,960
intelligence leak
in MI6 history.

435
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,960
You expose this bastard,
Satchel,

436
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,320
and we'll hang him for treason.

437
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,640
You might find yourself
taking tea at Buckingham Palace.

438
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,960
LORRAINE (over speaker):
So no, I wasn't just looking

439
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,320
for the list
in Gascoigne's apartment.

440
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
(tires squealing)

441
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,160
(car doors opening)

442
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,320
(men shouting in German)

443
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,960
LORRAINE: Percival
and I seem to have

444
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,960
a different definition
for collaboration.

445
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,160
(speaking German)

446
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,960
GRAY: What's that
supposed to mean?

447
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,960
LORRAINE:
He was the only one who knew

448
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,800
I was going
to Gascoigne's apartment.

449
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,000
And if I knew he was
going to call the police,

450
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,960
I would have worn
a different outfit.

451
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
## All I wanted #

452
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,800
## Just to see my baby's #

453
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,960
Different outfit?

454
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
## Blue eyes shine #

455
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
## This time I think
that my lover #

456
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,960
-## Understands me #
-## Understands me #

457
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
## If we have faith
in each other #

458
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,800
## Then we can be #

459
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
## Strong, baby #

460
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,320
-(grunting, groaning) -## I will
be your father figure #

461
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
## Put your tiny hand in mine #

462
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
## I will be
your preacher teacher #

463
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
## Anything you have in mind #

464
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,960
## I will be
your father figure #

465
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
## I have had enough of crime #

466
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
## I will be the one
who loves you #

467
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960

continue)

## If you are the desert,
I'll be the sea #

## If you ever hunger,
hunger for me #

471

## Whatever you ask for #

472
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,960
## That's what I'll be #

473
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,160
(grunting and groaning
continue)

474
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,960
## So when you remember #

475
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
## The ones who have lied #

476
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,800
(men groaning inside)

477
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,640
## Who said that they cared #

478
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
## But then laughed
as you cried #

479
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
(yells)
(grunting and groaning)

480
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
## Beautiful darling #

481
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,640
## Don't think of me #

482
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
## Because all I ever
wanted... #

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,960
(officers shouting in German)

484
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
## My love is always
telling me so #

485
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
-## Heaven is a kiss
and a smile ## -(gunfire)

(gun clatters on sidewalk)

501
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,960
REPORTER: With repeated
calls for change on the streets

502
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
and the protesters
growing ever more confident,

503
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,960
time is running out
for the East German government.

504
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,160
Popular opinion has it

505
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,960
that the Communists' claim
to leadership

506
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
can't be upheld much longer.

507
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,960
And if rapid change
is not forthcoming,

508
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,320
today's relatively calm
protests

509
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,960
could be seen as the calm
before the storm.

510
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,960
It's not just new faces
that are called for,

511
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,960
but perhaps a complete
demolition of the wall.

512
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,960
(German punk rock song
playing over stereo)

513
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,640

00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,960
PERCIVAL:
Mmm.

515
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,960
Let me take your coat.

516
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
Make yourself at home.

517
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Fucking hell.

518
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
PERCIVAL:
You want a pair of jeans?

519
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,000
Help yourself.

520
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,320
(Percival coughs)

521
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Hmm.

522
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,960
Your library
includes Larry Flynt?

523
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,320
Champion of free speech.

524
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,960
Hmm.

525
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
What have you found on Bakhtin?

526
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Look, if Bakhtin wanted
the Russians to have that list,

527
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
he would have given it
to them by now.

528
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,960
We just have to wait
for him to make his move.

529
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,960
We can't afford to wait.

530
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
This is your city, Percival.

531
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,320
Or do you only know
doormen and bellhops?

532
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,960
So, what did you find
in Gascoigne's apartment?

533
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,480
Some Deutsche Marks,

534
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,000
empty passports, travel visas

535
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,960
and a picture of the two
of you together a few years
back.

536
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,000
Did I not mention
that we were friends?

537
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,960
-No.
-No?

538
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,960
No, I must have forgot to.

539
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,960
Get your coat, love.

540
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,160
We're going for a walk.

541
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,160
PERCIVAL: Look, we're all
exposed by that list.

542
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,960
(Percival coughs)

543
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,320
And saving the world
is cool and all that,

544
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,960
but my main objective
is staying alive.

545
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
I've been head of
Berlin Station for ten years.

546
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
You've got to know
that I'm the only man

547
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,960
in this town that can help you
get that list.

548
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,960
Yes, I've read your file.

549
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,480
I've also read your dog file.

550
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,000
So let's cut the crap,
shall we?

551
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,160
This whole hungover,
show-up-late,

552
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,960
don't-know-which-way-is-up act,
I'm not buying it.

553
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,960
I trust you about as far
as I can throw you.

554
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,800
"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."

555
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,960
Niccolo Machiavelli.

556
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,320
It was on your shelf.

557
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,960
Oh, my God,
I think I fucking love you.

558
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
That's too bad.

559
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,960
If Percival was telling
the truth about Bakhtin,

560
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,960
I needed to figure out
what the Russians knew.

561
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,320
## Zwei drei vier, one, two
three, it's easy to see #

562
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,640
## But it's not
that I don't care so #

563
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,960
## Cos I hear it
all the time #

564
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,960
## But they never let you
know on the TV and the radio #

565
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,960
## She was young,
her heart was pure #

566
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,960
## But every night
is bright she got #

567
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,000
## She said sugar is sweet,
she come rappin' to the beat #

568
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
## Then I knew
that she was hot #

569
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
## She was singin',
don't turn around, oh, oh #

570
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,960
## Schau schau, Der Kommissar's
in town, oh, oh #

571
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,160
## You're in his eye,
and you'll know why #

572
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,320
## The more you live,
the faster you will die #

573
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,960
(quiet, indistinct
chatter)

574
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,960
## Alles klar, Herr Kommissar? #

575
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
Stoli on ice.

576

00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,960
(piano playing
"As Time Goes By")

579
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,960
I'm not speaking German
tonight.

580
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,000
So, you're British?

581
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,160
Very impressive.

582
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,960
This can't be your only talent.

583
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,960
Talents can be overrated.

584
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
A dedication...

585
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,000
a loyalty
is very rare these days.

586
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,960
Everyone here is searching
for something.

587
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
What are you looking for?

588
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,480
Well, when all's said and
done, wouldn't you say deep down

589
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,960
we're all just searching
for the same thing?

590
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,960
WOMAN: I leave you alone
for only a moment,

591
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
and already you are
attracting admirers.

592
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Monsieur,
three is not always a crowd,

593
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,960
but tonight it is.

594
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,960
BREMOVYCH:
Hmm.

595
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,960
French women.

596
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,960
What about the British?

597
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,960
Maybe we could make
some sort of, uh, arrangement.

598
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,960
We haven't seen each other
in a long time,

599
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,960
and we really need to catch up.

600
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,480
Alone.

601
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,960
Ladies,
Berlin is a small place.

602
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,800
I'm sure our paths
will cross again.

603
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
Sorry.

604
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,000
You looked like
you needed saving.

605
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,960
Well, I appreciate
the gesture, Miss...

606
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
Lasalle.

607
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,960
Delphine Lasalle.

608
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,960
Pleased to meet you.

609
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,960
So, what do you do, Delphine?

610
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,960
I'm a part-time translator
who really wants to be a poet.

611
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
Maybe a rock star.

612
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,000
(chuckles)

613
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,960
My friend owns a club nearby.

614
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Want to come check it out?

615
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,320
-Now?
-Sure.

616
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,960
I can't.

617
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Well, I'll give you
the address anyway.

618
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,160
Come meet me there
tomorrow night?

619
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,960
Will you come?

620
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
Maybe?

621
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,960
You're relentless.

622
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
Oui.

623
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,480
(clamoring, cameras clicking)

624
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,960
David Hasselhoff's
in town.

625
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Lucky us.

626
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
Berlin is truly doomed.

627
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,160
(bells chiming)

628
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,960
(watches and clocks ticking)

629
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
Your watch is ready.

630
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,960
It's on the counter
in that plain envelope.

631
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,480
I think you'll find my contact
very useful.

632
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,960

and the Banshees plays)

633

WATCHMAKER (over speaker):
Your watch is ready.

634
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,960
It's on the counter
in that plain envelope.

635
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,960

very useful.

REPORTER:
East Berliners stormed

637
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,160
the West German embassies
in Czechoslovakia

638
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,960
earlier this week,
as the Czech government

639
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
has begun to wave the refugees

640
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
through checkpoints
with few questions.

641
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,960
One has to ask how long
the East Berlin government

642
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,960
-can hold on...
-(news broadcast fades)

643
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,000
## You were running
out of time #

644
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
## Under the mountain,
a golden fountain #

645
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
## Were you praying
at the Lares shrine? #

646
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,000
## But oh #

647
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
## Oh, your city lies in dust #

648
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960
## My friend #

649
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,480
## Oh... #

LORRAINE:
Bakhtin and the list

651
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
had not yet surfaced
in the West.

652
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,480
I needed to meet
my new contact

653
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,960
and see what I was up against
in the East.

654
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,960
(dogs barking in distance)

655
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,960
You should have applied
for a visitor's permit.

656
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
What kind of work do you do?

657
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
Legal affairs.

658
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,480
If you do not return
before 6:00,

659
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,960
you will be arrested.

660
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Do you understand?

661
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,960
I understand.

662
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,960
(dog barks, whimpers)

663
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,800
Right now I'm not feeling
very confident

664
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,960
about this story of yours.

665
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Why not use Percival's
connections in the East?

666
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,960
He told me...

667
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,320
to trust no-one.

668

And you were followed.

694
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,160
I'm late
because I was followed.

695
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,320
I lost them 20 minutes ago
near the Palast der Republik.

696
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,960
You're as good
as your reputation.

697
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,960
Are you sure this
is the best place to meet?

698
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,000
Keep your enemies close.

699
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,800
I'm a permanent fixture
for them now.

the last few days.

703

-Any sign of Bakhtin?
-No.

704
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,960

has people worried

on both sides of the wall.

706
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,960
Yeah.

707
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,480
What kind of network
have you assembled?

708
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,960
There's a lot of, uh,
dissatisfied youth

709
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,960
on this side of the wall.

710
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,960
They're like a...

711
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,160
tinderbox.

(door closes)

719
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,960
I am interested
in selling a watch.

720
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,960
What are you selling?

721
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,960
It is extremely valuable.

722
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,480
Finest quality and...

723
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,960
filled with secrets.

724
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,960
Would you mind if I inspect
the merchandise?

725
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,960
Fuck yes, I mind.

726
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:06,800
Just tell potential buyers
Bakhtin is open for business.

727
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,960
(tape fast-forwarding)

728
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,960
BREMOVYCH (over tape): Ladies,
Berlin is a small place.

729
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,960
I'm sure our paths
will cross again.

730
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,000
(tape fast-forwarding)

731
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,960
LASALLE (over tape):
Sorry.

732
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,960
You looked like
you needed saving.

733
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,640
(tape fast-forwarding)

734
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,960
My friend owns a club nearby.

735
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,960
Want to come check it out?

736
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,640
## We got the message #

737
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,640
## I heard it on the airwaves #

738
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,640
## The politicians #

739
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,000
## Are now deejays #

740
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,960
## The broadcast
was spreading... #

741
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,960
I didn't think
that you would show.

742
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,960
Stoli on the rocks?

743
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,480
You pay attention.

744
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,000
I look for pleasure
in the details.

745
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,960
## The politics
of dancing #

746
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,960
## The politics of... #

747
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,160
Speaking of which--

748
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,960
I have been dying
to ask you a question.

749
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:27,960
## Aha, is this message
understood? #

750
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,960
## The politics
of dancing #

751
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,960
## The politics of #

752
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,960
## Ooh, feeling good #

753
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,160
Let's go someplace quiet.

754
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,480
## The politics of moving, aha #

755
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,960
## Is this message understood? #

756
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,960
(panting, moaning)

757
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,320
Why the gun, Delphine?

758
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,960
You're not as well-disguised
as you may think.

759
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,960
I know who you are.

760
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,960
You're Lorraine Broughton, MI6,

761
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,960
and you're here because
of the death of Gascoigne.

762
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,960
(Lasalle grunts, gasps)

763
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,960
What do you know
about Gascoigne?

764
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,960
Nothing.

765
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,320
But if someone is killing
Allied officers,

766
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,960
shouldn't we all care?

767
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,960
Whatever is in that list has
people willing to kill for it.

768
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,960
(uncocks gun)

769
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,320
This is my first assignment
with the French intelligence.

770
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,320
I've only been
here a year.

771
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,800
(Lasalle takes
deep breath)

772
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,480
I'm scared, OK?

773
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,960
I got into this
because it was exciting.

774
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,960
But it's never been
like this in Berlin.

775
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,960
You should have become a poet.

776
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,480
Or a rock star.

777
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,960
(Lasalle chuckles)

778
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,960
## #

779
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,960
## #

780
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,160
So you made contact
with the French operative?

781
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,960
Obviously.

782
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Why?

783
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,960
I believed she had information
I could exploit.

784
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,960
Nothing more.

785
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,960
KURZFELD:
And did she?

786
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,320
Did she have any information,
Lorraine?

787
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,960
There is something
I need to tell you.

788
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,960
It has to do with your friend
Percival. He's...

789
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,960
("Voices Carry"
by 'Til Tuesday plays)

790
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,960
## Because I know... #

791
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,960
Lorraine?

792
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,960
GRAY: Did she have
any information, Lorraine?

793
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,960
## Oh, he tells me tears
are something to hide #

794
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,960
## And something to fear... #

795
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,960
KURZFELD:
Did she give you information?

796
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,640
She gave me nothing.

797
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,960
## And I try so hard
to keep it inside #

798
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,800
## So no-one can hear... #

799
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,960
BAKHTIN:
David fucking Percival.

800
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,960
## Keep it down now,
voices carry... #

801
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,800
Are you following me?

802
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,960
Maybe you're not as good
at this spy shit as you think.

803
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,320
(grunts, yells)

804
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,800
That was for James,
you fucking prick.

805
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,960
Now, give me that fucking list.

806
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,960
GRAY:We needed to get you
a message, Lorraine.

807
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,960
We're several days into a
mission without a single
lead.

808
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,800
And plenty of
distractions.

809
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,800
You have to be reminded
of the course at hand.

810
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,320
Oh, I received your message.

811
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,480
KURZFELD:
That's quite a view.

812
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,320
70 miles of barbed wire,

813
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,960
310 guard towers,
65 anti-vehicle trenches,

814
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:33,640
40,000 Soviet-trained,
heavily armed frontier troops.

815
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,960
All that,
and 5,000 GDR citizens

816
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,960
still had the brass balls
to escape.

817
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,640
You've got the MI6 so worried

818
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,960
they called the CIA
to talk sense into you.

819
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,960
Eric Gray called me.

820
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,960
Of course he did.

821
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,800
I don't have to remind you of
how fast the clock is ticking.

822
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,960
If this thing gets out,

823
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,960
a lot of good,
hard-working folks...

824
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:04,640
brave men and women
are going to show up dead.

825
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,960
You and I included.

826
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,960
I swear to God,
the last few weeks,

827
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,960
I dread even waking up
in the morning.

828
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,160
I understand the severity
of the situation, sir.

829
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,640
And the time imperative.

830
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,960
Listen, I didn't climb
all the way up here

831
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,960
just to give you
some rousing pep talk.

832
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,960
So I'll cut to the chase.

833
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,960
Last night, you met a woman.

834
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,480
Delphine Lasalle
is out of her depth.

835
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,960
Given the climate, I'd
hate to see an executive order

836
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,960
come down the line
that falls in her disinterest.

837
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,960
Her disinterest?

838
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,960
What do you mean,
her disinterest?

839
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,960
Don't insult my intelligence,
Lorraine.

840
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,640
You know exactly
what I fucking mean.

841
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,960
Hope you get a snapshot.

842
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,960
Next week, this will be
a whole different picture.

843
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,960
(phone buttons beeping)

844
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,480
(line ringing)

845
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,960

Central has been compromised.

00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,000

848
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,640
## Stronger than reason #

849
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,960
## Stronger than lies #

850
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,800
## The only truth I know#

851
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,960
## Is the look in your eyes #

852
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:56,640
## The look in your eyes... #

853
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,960
(phone buttons beeping)

854
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,160
(line ringing)

855
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:11,960
PERCIVAL: Meet me at the Rough
Trade Bar at Oranienstrasse.

856
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,960
We need to talk.

857
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,960
## Just like a knife #

858
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,960
## My favorite weapon #

859
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,960
## Is the look in your eyes... #

860
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,800
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

861
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,000
PERCIVAL:
Look at all these hedonists.

862
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,960
It's like a beautiful woman
gone wrong. I fucking love it.

863
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,960
Word is Bakhtin has resurfaced.

864
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,960
Cops found him
with a homemade lobotomy.

865
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,960
Either way,
we have to deal with Spyglass.

866
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,960
Thinking it through, he
doesn't have much time over
there.

867
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,960
Our priority is the list.

868
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,960
-We can't make mistakes.
-Come on.

869
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,640
He's hardly the most
trustworthy person I ever met.

870
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,960
(chuckling):
Or the fucking brightest.

871
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,960
Wait.
You said you hadn't met him.

872
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,960
I lied.

873
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,960
And he claims to have
memorized the entire list.

874
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,480
He's ready to make the jump.

875
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,960
GRAY: You believe he committed
the entire thing to memory?

876
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,960
Everything.

877
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,960
Had I known earlier, I
would have prioritized Spyglass.

878
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,960
His knowledge made him
as valuable as the list.

879
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,960
I could have grabbed him
at any moment.

880
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,960
Instead,
Percival kept it a secret,

881
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,960
putting us in
a precarious position.

882
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,480
(bells chiming)

883
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,960
PERCIVAL:Look, the KGB
are going to have

884
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,960
some very angry bastards out
there looking for Spyglass.

885
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,960
We can't trust any
of the old

886
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,960
usual methods.

887
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,960
It's not that difficult

888
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,960
to drive across
the border these days.

889
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,960
It is when you're wanted
like Spyglass is.

890
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,960
We have to walk him across
personally

891
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,960
to ensure his safety
in plain sight.

892
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,960
We'll use the demonstration
tomorrow at Alexanderplatz.

893
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,960
That's insane.

894
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,960
All those protesters
will make a great distraction.

895
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,960
Spyglass is my guy.

896
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,960
We're going to do it my way.

897
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,320
Fine.

898
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:07,800
But we use my contact
to get all our papers in order.

899
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,960
All right.

900
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,960
We have a deal?

901
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,960
(sighs)
I'll take that as a yes.

902
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,960
(groans, sighs)

903
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,480
You see...

904
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,960
I received a call

905
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,960
from David Percival
that evening, Lorraine.

906
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,960
He said he had the list.

907
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,960
PERCIVAL: I'll need
a little time to wrap it up.

908
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,960
GRAY:And he knew
the identity of Satchel.

909
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,960
(chuckles)

910
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,960
Oh, I'm very close to Satchel.

911
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,960
(sighs)

912
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:15,960
And no-one thought to tell me?

913
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,960
LORRAINE:
Hmm?

914
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,960
(both chuckle softly)

915
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,800
(grunts)
Fuck.

916
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,480
You brought a lot of friends.

917
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,960
I heard Bakhtin
had a little accident.

918
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,960
I heard he slipped
and fell on an ice pick.

919
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,960
Berlin's a cruel mistress.

920
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,960
Especially for traitors
like Bakhtin.

921
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,960
Oh, don't be
such a fucking Communist.

922
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,960
You've got a problem.

923
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,800
Yeah, I know.

924
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,960
You have the fucking list.

925
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,320
We've been in the trenches
long enough to know

926
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,640
that at times like this
Berlin has its own set of rules.

927
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,960
I can give you information
that will keep the balance.

928
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,960
Now, are you in or out?

929
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,000
(thunder rumbling)

930
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,960
Percival's trying to set me up.

931
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,960
Are you surprised?

932
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,160
Not really.

933
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,960
These relationships
aren't real.

934
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,960
They're just a means to an end.

935
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,960
When you tell the truth,
you look different.

936
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,960
Your eyes change.

937
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,960
(both chuckle)

938
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,000
Thanks for the warning.

939
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:36,960
What do you mean?

940
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,480
I mean,
I better not do it again.

941
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,960
Why?

942
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,800
Cos it's going to get me
killed one day.

943
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,640
("Behind the Wheel"
by Depeche Mode playing)

944
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,960
## #

945
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,160
(announcement in German
over P.A.)

946
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:23,960
(dog barks)

947
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:24,960
## My little girl #

948
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,960
-## Drive anywhere #
-(dog barks)

949
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:36,320
-## Do what you want #
-(dog barking)

950
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,960
## I don't care #

951
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,960
## Tonight #

952
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,160
## I'm in the hands of fate #

953
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,960
## I hand myself #

954
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,960
## Over on a plate #

955
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,960
## Now... #

956
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,960
(video game music playing)

957
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,960
Well, I am impressed.

958
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:14,960
I thought Merkel here
was just a good bartender.

959
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,960
You smell like a Stasi officer.

960
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:29,960
Shave off that moustache.

961
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,960
Use that soap and cologne.
It's from the West.

962
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,960
You can't take anything
from the East.

963
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,960
LORRAINE: Merkel will
give you some clothes.

964
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,320
Right this way, Mr. Spyglass.

965
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,960
## Oh, little girl... #

966
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,960
## I'd rather not be #

967
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,960
## The one behind the wheel #

968
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,960
## Come #

969
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:00,960
## Pull my strings #

970
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,640
## Watch me move #

971
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,960
(crowd chanting indistinctly)

972
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,960
## I do anything #

973
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,960
(chanting continues)

974
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:12,960
## Please... #

975
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,960
It should have been easy.

976
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,960
The plan was sound.

977
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,960
Whatever went wrong did so
because someone wanted it to.

978
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:22,960
Someone from the inside.

979
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,960
GRAY: Were you betrayed
by a fellow agent?

980
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,960
KURZFELD:
You mean Satchel?

981
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,960
Would that be unheard of?

982
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,960
Per your request.

983
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,320
You won't be needing that.

984
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,960
It will be worse
if they find it on you.

985
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,960
Everything else ready?

986
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,960
Yes. Everything you requested.

987
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,480
SPYGLASS:
I'm ready.

988
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,960
What do you think of his shirt?

989
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,960
I wouldn't be
caught dead in it.

990
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,960
But for him, it's perfect.

991
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,960
Stand over here.

992
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,960
Now look like a free man.

993
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,960
(camera clicks)

994
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:09,960
REPORTER:
East Berlin peace leaders

995
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,960
have organized a demonstration
this week at Alexanderplatz.

996
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,960
(news broadcast continues
indistinctly)

997
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,960
Did he tell you
I memorized the whole list?

998
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,320
Yes.

999
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,960
SPYGLASS:
I realise I may not be

1000
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,640
as valuable
to some people and...

1001
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:33,960
some people may even
want me dead, but...

1002
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,960
...what choice do I have?

1003
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,960
You're no good to me dead.

1004
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,960
And I've never lost a package.

1005
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,960
I know.

1006
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,160
(door opens and closes)

1007
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,640
(Percival sighs)

1008
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,960
Hey, hey, hey.

1009
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,960
It's his family.

1010
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,960
This was not part of the plan.

1011
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,320
Part of mine.

1012
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,640
Please.

1013
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,960
PERCIVAL:
I'll take the wife and kid.

1014
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,960
You just have to deal
with Spyglass.

1015
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:12,800
I don't know if I have
enough passports.

1016
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,960
Percival.

1017
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,960
Your old golden boy.

1018
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,960
## #

1019

1020
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,800
(crowd chanting indistinctly)

1021
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,640
We have to go.

1022
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,960
See you in the West.

1023
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:54,960
Good luck.

1024
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,960
(chanting continues)

1025
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,480

(whistles)

1029
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,160
This was never part
of the plan.

1030
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,960
It was part of mine.

1031
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,960
(thump)

1032
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,960
(silenced gunshot)

1033
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:43,960
Stay low.

1034
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,960
(Spyglass groaning)

1035
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,960
In here.

1036
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,960
LORRAINE:
I need to deal with this now,

1037
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,960
or we'll never get across.

1038
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,320
I don't want to die.

1039
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,160
You're not going to die.

1040
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,960
Stay here.

1041
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,480

Two more. There's two more.

(gunfire)

1077
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,960
You need to stop that bleeding.

1078
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,960
Search for anything.

1079
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,320
Alcohol, rags.

1080
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,960

1081
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,960

Am I a bitch now?

Get in.

1107
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,320
Get in!

You need to work

(horn honks)

1112
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:43,960

01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:56,640
## A beam of light #

You all right?

1144
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,640
Yeah.

1145
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,960
We have to go...

(gasping, coughing)

1152
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,000
Just breathe.

So...

Yes, I-I think I understand
everything.

1163
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:24,960
You made your plan.

1164
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,960
And you failed to get
the high-value asset

1165
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:29,960
safely across to the West.

1166
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,960
You sent me into
a fucking hornet's nest.

1167
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:35,960
I was made by the KGB

1168
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:38,960
from the moment my feet
touched the ground.

1169
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,960
Maybe even before.

1170
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,960
But then you knew that,
didn't you?

1171
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,640
You had your doubts
about Percival,

1172
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,960
and you used me
to shake him down.

1173
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,960
Ready when you are.

Hey, hey...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Whoa, whoa.
It's me. It's me.

1180
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,000
He's dead.

1181
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,960
Spyglass is dead.

1182
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,960
And you are alive.

1183
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,960
They're all listening to me.

1184
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,000
They knew.

1185
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,960
The KGB knew everything.

1186
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,320
I need to get across.

1187
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,960

-than a royal goat fuck.
-I know. We're sorry.

1191
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:36,960
Oh, no, wait.
You lot don't have

1192
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,960
your own private
Stasi agent, do you?

1193
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,960
Not one with
a photographic memory.

KURZFELD: We need to
get with Broughton

1195
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:51,960
and get on the same page.

1196
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:55,960
We need that list--
now more than ever.

1197
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,960
Broughton?

1198
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,960
She made it out.

1199
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,960
Right.

1200
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:09,000
You know, a beautiful Italian
girl once said to me, "David...

1201
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,960
you can't unfuck
what's been fucked."

1202
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,960

believed possible
has happened tonight.

1206
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,960
The wall is coming down.
The wall is down.

break the wall down, you know.

REPORTER:
The wall is crumbling.

The sledgehammers

tear into it.

And behind it,

1213
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,960
the East German soldiers
tried to stop the tide.

1214
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,160
Water cannons were brought out.

1215
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,960
But the West Berliners
were determined.

1216
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,800
One West Berliner

It is the moment

Berliners have waited
28 years for.

1222
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,960
Even the East Germans
seem exhilarated.

1223
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:03,960
A symbolic breach
in the structure

1224
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,960
that cost hundreds of lives
and separated friends,

1225

families and lovers
for decades.

in my coat after Spyglass died.

I now believe it was Percival
who planted it.

1229
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,960
Made it look like Lasalle.

You need to leave Berlin.

1235
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,960
Well, when I didn't hear
from you, I got worried.

1236

How naive can you be?

1237
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:59,800
We chose this life, Delphine.

1238
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,960
This only ends one way.

talking about?

Oh, Lasalle,
listen to me very carefully.

You have no idea

Come on, now.
This is the game.

I know your

better than you think.

(fireworks popping)

1257
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:12,960
## I'm in the dark,
I'd like to read his mind #

1258
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:21,960
## But I'm frightened
of the things I might find #

1259
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,480
## Oh, there must be something
he's thinking of #

1260
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:26,960
## To tear him away #

1261
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,960
(song continues
over radio)

1262
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,960
## When I tell him
that I'm falling in love #

1263
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,960
## Why does he say #

1264
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:40,640
## Hush, hush... #

1265
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,960
LORRAINE (over speaker):
Percival is trying

1266
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,800
to set me up.

1267
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,320
LASALLE (over speaker):
Are you surprised?

1268
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,960
LORRAINE:
Not really.

1269
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,960
These relationships
aren't real.

1270
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,640
They're just a means to an end.

1271
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:56,000
LASALLE: When you tell
the truth, you look different.

1272
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,960
Your eyes change.

1273
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,960
LORRAINE:
Thanks for the warning.

1274
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:02,960
LASALLE:
What do you mean?

1275
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,960
LORRAINE: I mean,
I better not do it again.

1276
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:06,960
LASALLE:
Why?

1277
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:10,960
LORRAINE: Cos it's
going to get me killed one day.

1278
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:17,960
LASALLE: There is something
that I need to tell you.

1279
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:26,320
It has to do
with your friend Percival.

1280
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,160
-He's...
-LORRAINE: Shh.

1281

(recording stops,
"Voices Carry" resumes)

1282
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:36,960
## Because I know
all the trouble I'll get #

1283
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:39,960
## Oh, he tells me tears
are something to hide #

1284
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:47,960
## And something to fear #

1285
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:48,960
## And I try so hard
to keep it inside #

1286
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:51,960
## So no-one can hear #

1287
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,960
(grunting and groaning)

1288
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:57,960
## Hush, hush #

1289
01:26:58,960 --> 01:26:59,960

I'm sorry, darling.

(yells in pain)

1313
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,960
This is the game.

REPORTER: Celebrations continue
in the streets tonight.

1336
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,960
From the moment the first wave

1337
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:00,960
of East Germans crossed
into Berlin,

1338
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,960
they have been showered
with champagne

1339
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,960
and cheered by a crowd
of thousands.

1340
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,960
It is clear this will be one
of Berlin's most dramatic days.

1341
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,960
East Berliners are overcome
as they cross the border

1342
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,960
that has been closed to them
for 28 years.

1343
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:14,960
West Berliners
are chipping away

1344
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,960
at the wall that scarred
their city and scaling it.

1345
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:24,960
(panting quietly)

1346
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,960
("99 Luftballons" by Kaleida

REPORTER: There is no more
interference from the police.

1348
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,960
Unified, Berliners
lay symbols of peace.

1349
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:40,960
Thousands of them looking east
and chanting,

1350
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,960
"Down with the wall."

## #

1352
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:07,960
There's only one question
left to ask.

1353
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:09,960
Who won?

1354
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,960
And what was
the fucking game anyway?

1355
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,800
MAN (over TV):
And I was thinking,

1356
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:16,800
the wall will never fall.

1357
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,960
KURT LODER (over TV):
Germany's peaceful revolution

1358
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,960
is probably the political
and cultural story of 1989.

1359
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,960
We're going to take a
quick break, but we'll be back

1360
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,800
with an in-depth look
at the number-one

1361
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:25,960
musical controversy
of the year-- sampling.

1362
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,960
Is it art,
or is it just plagiarism?

1363
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:29,960
Don't go away.

1364
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:33,960
("99 Luftballons" continues)

1365
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:40,960
To win, first you have to know
whose side you're on.

1366
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:48,000
PERCIVAL:
In our line of work,

1367
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,960
that's right up there
with black holes

1368
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,960
or "to be or not to be."

1369
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:55,960
You fight the good fight,
and then one day

1370
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:58,960
you wake up and you realise
that all you were

1371
01:30:58,960 --> 01:30:59,960
was Satan's little helper.

1372
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:03,000
(crowd cheering,
fireworks popping)

1373
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:17,000
(fireworks whistling
and popping)

1374
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:20,960
PERCIVAL:
Ironic.

1375
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,960
The news will tell them there
will be no more secrets.

1376
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:29,960
But you and I, we both
know that's not true.

1377
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:34,960
The world is
run on secrets.

1378
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,800
-(air hissing)
-(gasps)

1379
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,960
Whoever has that list
has power.

1380
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:45,960
And without it, you're just
another fucking target.

1381
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,960
(camera shutter clicking)

1382
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,960
PERCIVAL:
So, what have I learned

1383
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,960
after all this time?

1384
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,960
After all
the sleepless nights,

1385
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:00,000
lying to friends,
lovers, myself?

1386
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,960
Playing this crooked game
in this crooked town

1387
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:06,960
filled with backstabbers
and four-faced liars?

1388
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,960
I'll tell you
what I've learned.

1389
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,960
One thing and
one thing only.

1390
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,320
I fucking love Berlin!

1391
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,960

1394
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,160
(Percival gasping)

1395
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,960
You didn't have to kill her.

1396
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,960
You what... what...
you suddenly decided

1397
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:45,160
to develop a conscience
after all you've done?

1398
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:48,960
Have you noticed
how everyone you get close to

1399
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:49,960
ends up fucking dead?

1400
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:53,160
You gave Bremovych
the details of the plan.

1401
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:57,960
You went to the KGB
to take me out.

1402
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:00,960
You were too fucking scared
to do it yourself.

1403
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,960
Too smart, more like.

1404
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,960
If those KGB pricks
had done their part,

1405
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:10,960
I'd be on my way to a hand job
with the queen by now.

1406
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,960
I've read that list,

1407
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,960
Lorraine.

1408
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,960
And you feature heavily.

1409
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,960
Turns out you've been
a very naughty girl.

1410
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,960
Spyglass was a liability
to us all.

1411
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:28,960
I couldn't risk
leaving him with you.

1412
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,160
Where's the list, David?

1413
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,960
I don't have it.

1414
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,960
It's en route to MI6,
where it belongs.

1415

Are you going to lie
till the very end?

01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,960
(gulps, gasps)

1422
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,960
Truth and lies.

1423
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,320
People like us
don't know the difference.

1424
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,160
No, we know the difference,
David.

1425
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:10,960
We choose to ignore it.
