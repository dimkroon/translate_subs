RONALD REAGAN:
East and West

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,960
do not mistrust each other
because we're armed.

4
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,960
We're armed because
we mistrust each other.

5
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,800
Mr. Gorbachev,

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,480
tear down this wall.

26
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
How did you find me?

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Maybe you're not as good
at this spy shit as you think.

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,960
Satchel gave me up.

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,960
I always thought,
if I got tagged,

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,960
it would be by the best.

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,960
But you're not the best,
are you, Bakhtin?

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,960
What I have to tell you, sir,
is not for the CIA to hear,

92
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,160
Lorraine, you are the subject
of this debriefing,

93
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,960
-not its controller.
-I understand that.
