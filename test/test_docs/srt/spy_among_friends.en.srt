Before I-I begin, erm...

6
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,960
..I'd like to make it clear,
I... I didn't go to MI5.

7
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,960
You came to me.

8
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,960
All because of
a private conversation...

9
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,320
..or at least one that
I was lead to believe was private...

10
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,960
with a friend.

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,960
And, as unlikely as it may sound,

12
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,640
I have known Kim Philby
for a very long time...

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,960
..and, erm...

14
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,960
..I simply didn't put...
two and two to...

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,160
I still can't quite believe that...

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,960
I very much regret
that it has taken me all these years

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,640
to realise who he really is...

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,960
..and the despicable, hateful things
he's done.

Mrs Solomon's statement to MI5

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,960
is the final piece of the puzzle
that confirms everything

26
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,960

he defected in Helsinki last year.

Philby must, for the time being,

be viewed and treated
as a potential asset.

122
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,960
<font color="yellow">..I completely understand</font>
<font color="yellow">why you might need a moment or two</font>

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,960

<font color="yellow">if we now consider it broken?</font>

125
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,960
The word "escape"...
would suggest that

126
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,800
Philby was in some sort
of custody, which he was not.

127
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
But I do understand
the drive of your question,

128
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,960
and the answer is this -
I simply didn't think he'd run.

129
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,960
I was offering him complete immunity
and secrecy,

130
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,000
with a nice little retirement in the
country with his wife and children,

131
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,960
for a full confession of everything
he ever did for the KGB.

132
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,800
I didn't for a moment think
he'd choose Russia over that.

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,960
we've known each other forever,
so...

155
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
if you don't mind,
I'll get right to the point.

156
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,320
<font color="cyan">Oh, bloody hell.</font>

157
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,160
<font color="cyan">Would you believe it?</font>
<font color="cyan">I've left my pipe at home.</font>

158
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Ah...

159
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
<font color="cyan">Ah, good man.</font>

160
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,960
I came to tell you that your past
has caught up with you.

161
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
<font color="cyan">Oh?</font>

162
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
We found additional information
about you

163
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,480
that puts everything in place.

164
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,800
And now... even I'm convinced,
absolutely convinced...

165
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,960
..that you worked for
the Soviet intelligence service...

166
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,960
..right up until the end of the war.

169
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
<font color="yellow">you state loud and clear,</font>
<font color="yellow">as if for the record</font>

170
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
<font color="yellow">and anybody else</font>
<font color="yellow">who might be listening,</font>

171
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,960
<font color="yellow">that he stopped spying for</font>
<font color="yellow">the Soviets at the end of the war.</font>

172
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Yes.
<font color="yellow">Did he?</font>

173
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
<font color="yellow">So, that was a lie.</font>

174
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,960
A nuance...
<font color="yellow">A nuance.</font>

175
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,640
..to protect the relationship
with our American cousins

176
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,960
who, I assumed,
had to be listening...

177
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
<font color="yellow">Not as far as I know.</font>
..or would get hold of the tape.

178
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,480
<font color="yellow">Again, to my knowledge...</font>

179
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,000
Because if they ever discovered
that he had been active for the KGB

180
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,960
all the way up to now,

181
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,960
especially during his stint
in Washington from '49 to '51...

182
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,960
<font color="yellow">They'd be out for blood.</font>
Not just HIS blood.

183
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,960
<font color="yellow">So, am I right in saying</font>
<font color="yellow">that you were letting him know</font>

184
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,960
<font color="yellow">from the beginning you were willing</font>
<font color="yellow">to protect him from the Americans?</font>

185
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,960
I'd... rather like to think
of it as protecting the service...

186
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,960
<font color="yellow">And the country.</font>
..whilst, at the same time...

187
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,960
..trying to offer him
every incentive to tell the truth.

188
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,320
<font color="yellow">By the way, why wasn't he</font>
<font color="yellow">in some sort of custody?</font>

189
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Well, that's not how we...

190
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
I was trying to appeal
to his better nature.

191
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,960
<font color="yellow">As an Englishman.</font>
And husband.

192
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
And father.

193
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,960
<font color="yellow">How did you and he first meet?</font>

194
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,000
Not sure what that has to do
with what happened in Beirut.

195
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,960
<font color="yellow">Oh, er, wh-what happened</font>
<font color="yellow">in Beirut...</font>

196

The first thing I noticed about Kim

229
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,960
was that he had this capacity
to draw people in...

230
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,960
and sort of appeared,
just in how he carried himself,

231
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,960
to know things no-one else knew...

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,960
<font color="yellow">Why did you let him go?</font>

331
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,960
I didn't. He ran.

332
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
<font color="yellow">At night.</font>

333
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,960
<font color="yellow">He waited until after dark.</font>
<font color="yellow">That's all it took?</font>

334
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,800
<font color="yellow">Do you not think that in hindsight,</font>

335
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,960
<font color="yellow">perhaps MI5 should've gone</font>
<font color="yellow">to Beirut, not you?</font>

336
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
Kim gave me an eight-page,
signed confession,

337
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,960
that he never would've given
anyone from MI5.

338
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,960
<font color="yellow">Ooh, right, yeah.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sorry, you mean this?</font>

339
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

340
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960

<font color="yellow">you're not telling me?</font>

343
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,960
When I...
grasped the scope of his betrayal...

344
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,960
..I realised that our friendship
had led, over the years, to...

345
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,800
..the deaths of hundreds...

346
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,960
..possibly thousands of people
at the hands of the Soviets.

347
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
Try to imagine for a moment,
if you will...

348
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,960
..how that might feel, and...

349
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,160
..give me one good reason
why I'd deliberately let him go.

350
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,000

<font color="yellow">Firstly, you were friends for years.</font>

351
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,960
<font color="yellow">Second, there's his wife</font>
<font color="yellow">and children, not to mention SIS,</font>

352
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,960
<font color="yellow">all of whom I'm sure you wanted</font>
<font color="yellow">to protect from a public scandal.</font>

353
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,640
<font color="yellow">So I have to ask if the two of you</font>
<font color="yellow">came to some sort of quid pro quo</font>

354
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,960
<font color="yellow">out there in Beirut?</font>

355
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960

Mr MacMillan, the Foreign Secretary,

said there was no evidence that
you were the so-called "Third Man"

408
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
who allegedly tipped off
Burgess and Maclean.

409
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,960
Are you satisfied with

<font color="cyan">Yes, I am.</font>

411
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Well, if there WAS a third man,
were you, in fact, the third man?

412
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
<font color="cyan">No, I was not.</font>
Do you think there was one?

<font color="cyan">No comment.</font>

414
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Mr Philby, the disappearance
of Burgess and Maclean

415
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,320
is almost as much of a mystery today
as it was when they went away -

416

about four years ago or more.

417
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,960

425
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,960

427
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,960
And the Foreign Secretary
has said that in the past,

428
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
you had communist associations.

429
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,960
Is that why
you were asked to resign?

430
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,800
<font color="cyan">I was asked to resign</font>
<font color="cyan">because of an imprudent association.</font>

431
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,960
That was your association
with Burgess. <font color="cyan">Correct.</font>

432
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
What about these alleged
communist associations?

433
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Can you say anything about them?

<font color="cyan">I spoke to a communist,</font>

435
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,960
<font color="cyan">knowing him to be a communist,</font>
<font color="cyan">was sometime in 1934.</font>

436
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,320
That rather implies that you've also
spoken to communists unknowingly

437
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,960
and you now know about it.

438
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,960
<font color="cyan">Well, I spoke to Burgess last</font>
<font color="cyan">in April or May of 1951.</font>

439
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Would you still regard Burgess,
who...

440
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,960
lived with you
for a while in Washington,

441
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,960
would you still regard him
as a friend of yours?

442
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
How do you feel about him now?

443
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,000
<font color="cyan">I consider his action deplorable.</font>

444
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,960
<font color="cyan">On the subject of friendship,</font>

445
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,960

We were on the brink of war,

488
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,960
without doing all that marching

489
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,160

When I was seven, my parents
sent me off to boarding school.

00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,960
A brutal place that reeked
of floor polish and custard.

495
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,160
Sometimes, at night,
when everyone was asleep,

496
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,960
I'd climb out on the roofs,

497
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,800
where I'd imagine that
I was the Count of Monte Cristo...

498
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,960
..and plot my enemies' downfall
by means of surveillance,

499
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
disinformation, sabotage.

<font color="yellow">Why did Philby spy for the Russians?</font>

501
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,960

Double-crossing your friends,

Yes.

<font color="cyan">Er, how did that come about?</font>

517
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,800
Well, she was my secretary
for two years,

518
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,960
and I think the penny
must have dropped.

519

<font color="cyan">Yes, quite so, quite, quite.</font>
<font color="cyan">And what about your mother?</font>

520
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,000
She thinks I work for something
called SIS,

521
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,960
which she believes stands for
Secret Intelligence Service.

522

<font color="cyan">Good God!</font>
<font color="cyan">How did she come to know that?</font>

A war cabinet... A member...
LAUGHTER

<font color="cyan">all sorts of damage.</font>

A member of the war cabinet
told her at a cocktail party.

<font color="cyan">Or, God forbid, a woman.</font>

600
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,960
<font color="yellow">So I wonder if Mr Elliott insisted</font>
<font color="yellow">he be the one to go to Beirut</font>

601
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,320
<font color="yellow">so that he and Philby could find</font>

<font color="yellow">..what if he went out there</font>
<font color="yellow">to initiate...</font>

607
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,960
<font color="yellow">an operation</font>
<font color="yellow">to run Philby back at the KGB?</font>

608
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
Bloody hell, you actually mean that.

00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,960

610
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,960
I'm sorry, I just don't believe...
<font color="cyan">That SIS are that devious?</font>

611
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,320
If they were running Philby back
into the USSR, they'd have told us.

612
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,960
<font color="cyan">Well, that's sweet, Arthur.</font>
<font color="cyan">Quite unlike you.</font>

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
<font color="green">Or at the very least,</font>

614
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,960
<font color="green">one would think</font>
<font color="green">they'd have asked us to back off.</font>

00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,960
<font color="green">Leave Elliott alone.</font>

616
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,960
<font color="yellow">What if he didn't even tell SIS</font>
<font color="yellow">what he was up to?</font>

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,480
<font color="yellow">Taxi's here.</font>

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,480
You look stunning.

<font color="green">You lost him? How?</font>

620
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,800
<font color="cyan">He's a pro, for sure.</font>

621
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,480
<font color="cyan">He gave me the slip in the church.</font>
<font color="cyan">Switched hat and coat.</font>

622
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,960
<font color="cyan">Now he's in the fucking wind.</font>
<font color="cyan">Long gone.</font>

623
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,480
