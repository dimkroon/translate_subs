Translate Subs
==============

This is an experimental Kodi addon intending to provide automatic 
translation of subtitles using various online translation services.

The addon basically re-packs the python package [translatepy](https://github.com/Animenosekai/translate) 
for Kodi and adds a little to:
* perform automatic translation
* offer subtitles text to the translation service in such a way to ensure 
  optimal translation result.
* optionally suppress colourisation of subtitles intended for the hearing 
  impaired.
* optionally suppress sound descriptions in subtitles intended for the 
  hearing impaired.
* optionally suppress lyrics of songs in subtitles intended for the 
  hearing impaired.
* Extend the time subtitles are shown on screen.
