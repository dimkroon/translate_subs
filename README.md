Translate Subs
==============

This is an experimental Kodi addon intending to provide automatic 
translation of subtitles using various online translation services.

The addon basically re-packs the python package [translatepy](https://github.com/Animenosekai/translate) 
for Kodi and adds a little to:
* perform automatic translation
* offer subtitles text to the translation service in such a way to ensure 
  optimal translation result.
* optionally suppress colourisation of subtitles intended for the hearing 
  impaired.
* optionally suppress sound descriptions in subtitles intended for the 
  hearing impaired.
* optionally suppress lyrics of songs in subtitles intended for the 
  hearing impaired.

Check the addon's settings to enable automatic translation and to set various 
other options.

The latest version of the addon can only perform automatic translation on 
subtitles provided by video add-ons that actively support translation. 
Currently, viwX is the only addon known to do so.

The addon is still at a very rough state. 
Development is primarily focused on translating western European languages, 
English in particular. Please drop a note on 
[Github discussions](https://github.com/dimkroon/translate_subs/discussions) 
if you encounter issues with a particular language, or file an issue at 
[Github](https://github.com/dimkroon/translate_subs/issues)
